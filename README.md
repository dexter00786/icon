# Icon Power Solutions - Component-Based Website

This project has been refactored from a single HTML file into a modular, component-based architecture for better maintainability and organization.

## How It Works

### Component Loading System
The `component-loader.js` file provides a dynamic component loading system that:

1. **Fetches Components**: Loads HTML files from the `components/` directory
2. **Injects Content**: Places component HTML into designated containers
3. **Processes Scripts**: Extracts and executes JavaScript from components
4. **Processes Styles**: Extracts and applies CSS from components
5. **Caches Components**: Stores loaded components for performance

### Usage

1. **Open the new version**: Use `index-new.html` instead of `index.html`
2. **Component containers**: Each component is loaded into a specific container div
3. **Automatic loading**: Components are loaded automatically when the page loads
4. **Independent styling**: Each component contains its own CSS and JavaScript

## Benefits of Component Architecture

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component is self-contained
- Easy to locate and modify specific sections
- Reduced code duplication

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused across different pages
- Easy to create variations of components
- Consistent styling and behavior

### 3. **Collaboration**
- Multiple developers can work on different components
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. **Performance**
- Components can be loaded on demand
- Better caching strategies
- Smaller initial page load

### 5. **Testing**
- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- Easier to write unit tests
- Better debugging capabilities

## File Organization

### CSS Structure
- **Shared CSS**: Common styles in `css/shared.css`
- **Component CSS**: Each component has its own `<style>` block
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries included in each component

### JavaScript Structure
- **Component Scripts**: Each component contains its own JavaScript
- **Global Scripts**: Shared functionality in `js/component-loader.js`
- **Event Handling**: Component-specific event listeners

## Browser Compatibility

The component system uses modern JavaScript features:
- **Fetch API**: For loading components
- **ES6 Classes**: For the component loader
- **Async/Await**: For asynchronous operations
- **Template Literals**: For string manipulation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Build System**: Add webpack or similar for bundling
2. **TypeScript**: Convert to TypeScript for better type safety
3. **State Management**: Add component state management
4. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for better performance
5. **Component Library**: Create a reusable component library

## Getting Started

1. Open `index-new.html` in a web browser
2. The component loader will automatically load all components
3. Each component will render with its own styling and functionality
4. All interactive features (carousel, navigation, forms) will work as expected

## Notes

- The original `index.html` file is preserved for reference
- All external resources (images, fonts) remain unchanged
- The component system is designed to be lightweight and fast
- No external dependencies are required
